# Kabongo_Emanuel_Integrated
Welcome to my Final Integrated Project!
For this FIP we were tasked with creating a 3 page website with the topic of our own choice, so I picked my pet dog, Pongo. Who's not really my pet, but my older cousin's but I still consider him very close. Throughout the year in Multimedia Production class (1052) we learned not only how to create HTML files and fill them with various content, but we also learnt how to style our HTML using Cascading Style Sheets, or CSS for short. It literally bring our whole project to life. When the professor gave us our template, it was all black and white, so it was up to us to make the difference! And thanks to CSS I made it possible. I was able to take pictures of Pongo, not only integrate them into the HTML but I could also style the pictures' position, whether I want them on the left, right or even center, CSS can do it all. It was intimidating at first due to all the values, words and numbers we had to work with, but once I set my eyes on the goal I went for it and made it happen.
